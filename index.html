        Metatags in header.

        1 Tag: br, hr
        2 Tags: center, pre, div, h1, s (line through), a, mark (highlight)

        Frequent Usage: 
        Helpful: i (italics), u (underline), b (bold).
        Rare Usage: 

        Normal Syntax:
        Body > Div > Content.

        Element v. Tag:
        Elements have an ending. Tags do not.

        <u><b>Attributes are characteristics of an element: ID, Class, Style, Title.</b></u>

        Title is used when you need something displayed as a tooltip.
        Style is having a mini stylization without using an entire different CSS file.

        ID v. Class:
        ID is referenced as # while Class is referenced as .

        You can also stack multiple Attributes in a single element.
        You can not stack multiple element tags even if they behave like attributes.
        Examples: i, u, b.
